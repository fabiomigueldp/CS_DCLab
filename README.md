## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the work done in the Digital Circuits Laboratory. It includes VHDL source files, testbenches, simulation scripts, and documentation. The projects cover fundamental topics in digital circuit design, including:
- Combinational logic
- Sequential circuits
- Finite State Machines (FSMs)
- More advanced digital systems as the course progresses

## Getting Started
To get started with these projects, you will need a VHDL simulator. Some popular options include:
- [ModelSim](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/model-sim.html)
- [GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl)

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of digital logic design
- Familiarity with VHDL syntax and simulation tools
- VHDL simulation software (e.g., ModelSim, GHDL)
